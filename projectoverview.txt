DTI Trends Project Overview Milestone 1

PM: Chris Chen
Group Members: Chris Zhang & Kevin Xu

Idea: Study Buddy

Frontend Pages: Login Page, Input & Prompt Page, Results Page 

    Login Page - nice design, two buttons (sign up and login), can login with email + password or login with Google, data is to be stored in mongodb atlas

    Input & Prompt Page - user will add notes either via text or (pdf?) with a prompt, will be feeded into 
    gpt model via api key

    Results Page - upon inputting, user will be brought to result page, ai response fetched and displayed such as 
    (practice questions, summarize key points, practice test, etc)

    maybe implement some milestone thing or score thing as a fun thing to keep user engaged (diffierentiate from just inputting into ai themselves)

Backend Overview: storing data in mongodb atlas, post method to feed input into model, fetching response from api, firebase for user authentication

??? should we store more data such as user previous questions in db? 
??? what else can we do to make it a little more unique and useful as a product
??? how should it look, what type of design
??? WHAT ELSE TO ADD THAT IS FEASIBLE?
